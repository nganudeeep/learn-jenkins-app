End-to-End CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, Docker, and AWS
------------------
Project Overview
------------------
* Built a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate build, test, and deployment workflows

* The project is fully implemented and version-controlled on GitHub, including Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, and source code

* Focused on real-world DevOps practices rather than only course-based examples

------------------
Objectives
------------------
* Automate the software delivery lifecycle from code commit to deployment

* Apply CI/CD and DevOps fundamentals in a practical, production-style setup

* Gain hands-on experience with Jenkins, Docker, AWS, and Linux

------------------
What Was Implemented
------------------
* Jenkins pipelines defined using a Jenkinsfile stored in GitHub

* Automated build and test stages triggered by source code changes

* Docker used to containerize applications and standardize build environments

* Environment variables and pipeline stages used to manage CI/CD flow

* Application deployment implemented using AWS services (S3 / ECS-style approach)

* GitHub integration for source control and pipeline triggering

* Clear commit history reflecting real development and pipeline updates

------------------
Tools & Technologies
------------------
* Jenkins – CI/CD orchestration

* Docker – Containerized builds and deployments

* AWS – Application deployment (S3, ECS concepts)

* GitHub – Source control and pipeline integration

* Linux – Shell commands used within pipelines

------------------
Key Learnings
------------------
* How to design and manage multi-stage Jenkins pipelines

* Practical use of Docker in CI/CD workflows

* Understanding Jenkins logs and troubleshooting pipeline failures

* Optimizing pipelines for faster feedback and reliable deployments

* Applying DevOps and CI/CD concepts in a real project setup

------------------
Why This Is a Real Project
------------------
* Entire implementation is available on GitHub

* Includes Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, and pipeline configurations

* Demonstrates hands-on CI/CD automation, not just theoretical learning

* Reflects how CI/CD pipelines are built and maintained in real teams
